In January 2021, the BBC Shared Data Unit [reported](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-55221474) people with non-visible disabilities such as autism or Parkinson's disease faced what a charity called a "shocking disparity" when applying for a blue badge parking permit.

Scores of councils had lower approval rates for non-visible disabilities applications compared to those for physical impairments.

Non-visible disability applications began in England in August 2019.

The Department for Transport (DfT) said it would review their impact.

James Taylor, from the disability charity Scope, said: "This new data shows a shocking disparity between the allocations of blue badges to people with invisible and visible impairments."

The National Autistic Society said the results showed how important it was for councils to improve training to ensure staff understood when people should be entitled to a "lifeline" blue badge.

The removal of accessible parking bays next to shops and amenities "overnight, without any consultation" to allow for social distancing during the Covid-19 pandemic had also had a "massive impact" on disabled people, Scope said.

Applications for people with cognitive impairments were already considered in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.

## Method

We obtained Freedom of Information Act (FOI) responses from the 216 upper-tier councils across the UK via the WhatDoTheyKnow website.

Of the 109 councils who gave full responses, eight out of 10 had higher approval rates for people with physical impairments. For ten of those councils, the difference was greater than 50 percentage points.
